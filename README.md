# BeatSaber_v1.20.0_Beatmaps_Fixer
Fixer for beatmaps that could not be loaded in Beat Saber

In Beat Saber 1.20.0 was added new beatmaps format. Wit it, in this version was broken support of some beatmap (especially generated via [Beat Sage](https://beatsage.com/) or [Osu2Saber](https://github.com/Ivan-Alone/Osu2Saber)), but also some handmaded beatmaps was broken too (from my collection, [Julius Dreisig - Invisible \(by *iilikechickennuggetz*\)](https://beatsaver.com/maps/1556d), [Egzod & Maestro Chives - Royalty \(by *ProtoPhonix*\)](https://beatsaver.com/maps/1c1b9)).

Listed beatmaps can't be played in Beat Saber 1.20.0 because bug that happens in game dev process.

## Bug description
It problem affect beatmaps, that has any formatting symbols (spaces, \t, \r, \n and etc.) in "difficulty.dat" file. JSON specifications are compatible with formatting, but from 1.20.0 BeatSaber does not.

Example:

```json
{"_version":"2.0.0","_events":[],"_notes":[],"_obstacles":[]}
```
![Ok empty map](https://github.com/Ivan-Alone/BeatSaber_v1.20.0_Beatmaps_Fixer/blob/main/img/ok.jpg?raw=true)

Itâ€™s valid empty level beatmap. No spaces, no any formatting, nothing extra. But this:

```json
{
  "_version": "2.0.0",
  "_events": [],
  "_notes": [],
  "_obstacles": []
}
```
![Infinite loading](https://github.com/Ivan-Alone/BeatSaber_v1.20.0_Beatmaps_Fixer/blob/main/img/loading.jpg?raw=true)
is invalid level, and beatmap with it will show infinite loading ring in menu.

Usually, auto generated beatmaps can contain formatting, but it can happen with any custom beatmap created with third-party editor, for example.
